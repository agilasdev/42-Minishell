# Introduction
## Unix-Shell
A Unix shell is a `command-line` interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for `Unix-like` operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
